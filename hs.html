<center><br>This is aptly named Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstione National Park.
It is the largest hot spring in United States and the third largest in the world. The spring gets its fantastic and vivid colours from 
bacteria around the edges of the mineral-rich water. 
The center of the pool is too hot to host life and so it remains a sterile, yet stunning blue colour.
