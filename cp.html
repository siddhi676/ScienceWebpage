<center><br>Extraordinary Critters: No, this is not some gaudily-coloured caterpillar..... it's a family of bee-eaters!
Bee-eaters are gregarious and skilled aviators that- you guessed it- feed primarily on bees and wasps, but won't turn down the odd flying insects.
They aggressively rub their prey against tree branches to remove the stingers.
Bee-eaters are found on most of the continents, but most commonly in Asia and Africa.
