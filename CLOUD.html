<center><br>This photograph,titled "Powerful Cloud",was<br>taken by Takashi for National Geographic and shows Japan's Mount Fuji capped with a rather
spectacular lenticular cloud.These clouds are caused by the flow of stable,moist air over a physical obstacle,like a mountain peak.
The air arises and then condenses and then sinks and evaporates,forming a capped,lentil-shaped cloud.
This same process occurs in multiple layers above <br>the obstacle,causing a number of lenticular clouds to form at varying heights.
